    Interview with grandparents
          <br><br>The survival of wild animals depends on how well a community lives in harmony with them. It is a traditional knowledge or culture that should be passed from generation to generation.
          If we think that our grandparents of the previous generation lived in harmony with nature without conflict, then it becomes part of our duty to know whether this opinion is true about our community 
          and if there are conservation practices, to follow them.
          <br><br>
          This activity has been designed to respect the experience-based knowledge base of the elderly souls, to interview them and record their experiences in today's mechanical life, where the occasions to 
          listen to their incredible stories are rare, and to respond to their many life experiences.
